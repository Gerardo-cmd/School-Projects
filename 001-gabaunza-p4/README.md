# Hashing-and-Graphs
This was a school project that focused on hash maps and graphs. It also includes a small gui that pops up whenever the program is run but that was coded by the professors.

When the program is run, a gui will appear displaying a graph consisting of nodes and edges. The user can change the mode to "edit" in order to add new nodes by simply clicking or new edges by clicking and then dragging one node to another node. It does not support self loops or parallel edges.
